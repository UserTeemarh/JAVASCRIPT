<h1><center>The conditional ternary</center></h1>
<p>the ternary operation is a conditional operator which evaluate either of two expressions. <b>a true expression</b> and <b>a false expression</b></p>
<p>it's used in-place of if and else statement but can only have two condition</p>
<h3>it is executed like this:</h3>
<p>a condition followed by a question mark <b>?</b>, then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon <b>:</b> and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy</p>

        <h2>practicals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>if your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator to log a string like this to the console: 'Nigeria's population is above average' otherwise, simply log 'Nigeria's population is below average'. Notice how only one word changes between these two sentences</li>
            <li>after checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. see the different results, and set the population back to original</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>coding challenge</h2>
        <p>stanley wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restauarant. in his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. if the value is different, the tip is 20%</p>
        <h3>Your Tasks:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. create a variable called 'tip' for this. it's not allowed to use an if/else statement</li>
            <li>print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and final value (bill + tip). example: "the bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value is 316.25"</li>
            <h3>Test Data</h3>
            <li><b>data 1:</b> test for bill values 275, 40 and 430</li>
            <h3>hints</h3>
            <li>to calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2</li>
            <li>value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && bill <= 300</li>
        </ul>
