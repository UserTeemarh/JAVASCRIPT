    <h1>WORKING WITH STRINGS</h1>
    <p>A string is a sequence of characters intended to represent text. Strings can contain any kind of character, like letters, numbers, or special characters.</p>
    <h2><u>The Basics of Strings in JavaScript
    </u></h2>
    <p class="p-border">In JavaScript, a string is a data type representing a sequence of characters that may consist of letters, numbers, symbols, words, or sentences.
    </p>
    <h3><u>How to create strings in JavaScript
    </u></h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, you can create strings by wrapping the text inside single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li><span>// A string created using single quotes</span><br>
                    let string1 = 'I am a very cool string! ðŸ˜Ž';<br>
                    <br>
                   <span> // A string created using double quotes</span><br>
                    let string2 = "I am a very cool string! ðŸ˜Ž";<br>
                    <br>
                    <span>// A string created using backticks, also known as template literal</span>
                    let string3 = `I am a very cool string! ðŸ˜Ž`;</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A string created using <strong>backticks</strong> are also known as <strong>template literals</strong> and possess special features.</p>
    <p>A string created using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks is generated as a primitive value, similar to numbers and boolean values. Primitive data are immutable, which means they cannot be changed. Also, they do not have any methods or properties.</p>
    <p>There is another way to create strings in JavaScript, which is via the <em>String() constructor.</em> The String() constructor generates a string as an object (when called with new).
