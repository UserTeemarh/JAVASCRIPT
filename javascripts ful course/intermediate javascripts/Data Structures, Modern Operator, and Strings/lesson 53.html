    <h1>THE LOGICAL ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR</h1>
    <p>Logical Assignment Operators are shorthand that combine logical operations with assignment.</p>
    <h2>1. <u>LOGICAL AND (&&=) ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR</u></h2>
    <p>The <small>Logical  Assignment Operator(&&=) </small> performs a logical AND operation between the variable and the right-hand side operand, then assigns the result to the variable if the result is <b>truthy</b>. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Example:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>let x = 5; <br>  x &&= 10; <br> <br><span>// Equivalent to: x = x && 10;</span></li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <!-- || operator -->
    <h2>1. <u>LOGICAL OR (||=) ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR</u></h2>
    <p>The <small>Logical  Assignment Operator(||=) </small> performs a logical OR operation between the variable and the right-hand side operand, then assigns the result to the variable if the result is <b>falsy</b>. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Example:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>let y = 5; <br>  y ||= 10; <br> <br><span>// Equivalent to: y = y || 10;</span></li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <!-- ?? operator -->
    <h2>1. <u>LOGICAL NULLISH (??=) ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR</u></h2>
    <p>The <small>Logical  Assignment Operator(??=) </small> performs a logical Nullish operation between the variable and the right-hand side operand, then assigns the result to the variable if the result is <b>null</b> or <b>undefined</b>. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Example:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>let x = 5; <br>  x &&= 10; <br> <br><span>// Equivalent to: x = x && 10;</span></li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <!-- pros and cons  of logical assignment operator -->
    <h3>Pros and Cos of Logical Assignment Operator</h3>
    <h4>PROS:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Conciseness:</b> They allow for more concise and readable code by combining logical operations with assignment in a single step.</li>
        <li><b>Reduced Boilerplate:</b> They reduce the need for additinal if statements or ternary operators for simple assignment based on logical conditions.</li>
        <li><b>Improved Expressiveness:</b> They make the code more expressive and declarative, especially for conditional assignments.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- CONS -->
    <h4>CONS:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Complexity:</b> While they can make simple operations more concise, they might increase the complexity and reduce readability for more complex scenarios.</li>
        <li><b>Potential Confusion:</b> Novice developers might find them confusing, especially if they are not familiar with the logical operations they are based on.</li>
        <li><b>Limited Use Cases:</b> They might not be suitable for all scenarios, especially when the logic involves multiple conditions or requires more complex handling.</li>
    </ul>

        <legend>EXERCISE AND CODING CHALLENGE</legend>
        <h3>EXERCISE</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some of the <b>book</b> objects from the <b>books</b> array are missing the edition property. Loop over the <b>books</b> array, and assign this property with a number 1 (if it doesn't already exist). Use logical assignment operators.</li>
            <li>Some of the <b>book</b> objects from the books array have the <b>highlighted</b> property, which by default is set to true. Iterate over the <b>books</b> array, and if the <b>thirdParty.goodreads.rating</b> property is less than <b>4.2,</b> reassign it with false.</li>
            <p>Use the &&= operator (tip: you may also need the ! operator)</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>CODING CHALLENGE:</h3>
        <li>Link for the Challenge Code</li>
        <ol>
           <li>Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and'players2')</li> 
            <li>The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players</li>
            <li>Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)</li>
            <li>During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'</li>
             <li>. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')</li>
            <li>Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)</li>
            <li>The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Test data for 6.</b>: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.
            Then, call the function again with players from game.scored</p>
